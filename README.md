# Synthetic-dataset-generation-for-machine-learning-models
This package helps in generation of huge datasets of  simulated images of an object,  that can be used to train object recognition machine learning models. This helps in avoiding the tedious process of collecting huge data-set of images and preparing them to be fed to machine learning models.
